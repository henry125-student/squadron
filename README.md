An old JavaFX project, containing some bad code practices I'd rather note replicate today, including Class/Interface/Inheritence abuse and instanceof overuse.

Main function is located at game/Game.java.

Move cursor to change move direction and select for other actions. Use number keys 1-6 to buy ships, letter keys q-y to command 'side-raids', and letter keys a-h to sell ships 
(assuming qwerty layout). Press shift to change storange rule/resource offloading behavior (not important). Press o to spectate; press p to respawn as player squad. 
Press space to pause/unpause.
